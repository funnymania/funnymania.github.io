enjoy: just a funny art sidebananas to gauge my speed on something tiny. 

I think it took me about an hour and a half to complete, including conception, 
which is decent, but a little long. I wanted to do more, but was getting sleepy. 

I want to make a series of little 90 minute long (to develop) web artworks

'90-minute-warts'?
